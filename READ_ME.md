# Enique OS

An Operating System Development Project called Enique OS made by me.

The purpose of this project is to learn about Operating System Concepts, Virtualization etc.

So, I will try to make everything from scratch, and because of that, there might be some bugs and technical unefficiency.

### Enique

Enique means 'Enter a unique idea'.

In other words, unleash your unique ideas.
